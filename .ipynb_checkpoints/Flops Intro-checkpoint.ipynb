Floating point numbers are a method for the representation of real numbers with fraction parts, making it possible to maintain a high degree of accuracy in calculations of scientific and other applications where the use of exact numbers is required. As compared to integer operations, floating-point operations are capable of handling a much broader spectrum of values and may represent enormous or incredibly small numbers depending upon the specific task that is to be performed therefore they are much more suitable for tasks that require a very large amount of computations than the integer operations."
